**1. Introduction:**

The project titled "Health Insurance Cross Sell" is a data science project aimed at developing a predictive model that can accurately predict which customers of a health insurance company are likely to purchase vehicle insurance. The project was carried out using Python programming language and various libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.

**2. Objective:**

The objective of the project was to build a classification model that can predict if a customer will buy vehicle insurance or not, based on the given set of attributes.

**3. Data Summary:**

The dataset contains information about 381,109 customers, including their age, gender, driving license status, region, previously insured status, vehicle age, vehicle damage, annual premium, and policy sales channel.

**4. Approach:**

The project involved the following steps:

Data cleaning and preprocessing: Handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
Exploratory data analysis (EDA): Gaining insights and identifying patterns or relationships in the data.
Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
Applying machine learning algorithms (logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost) to the training data and tuning hyperparameters using cross-validation.
Evaluating model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC curve.

**5. Conclusion:**

The project demonstrated the potential of data science in extracting insights from large datasets and developing predictive models. The gradient boosting algorithm achieved the best results, with an accuracy score of 0.87 and an F1 score of 0.56. The project provided valuable business insights, such as the importance of customer retention strategies for those who previously purchased insurance and the potential for targeted marketing campaigns based on customers with a history of vehicle damage. The results can be utilized by the health insurance company to enhance sales and marketing strategies, retain customers, and increase revenue.

By organizing the project summary into distinct sections, it becomes easier to follow the flow and understand the different aspects of the project.
